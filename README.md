# Continuous Delivery Pipeline for Node.js Web App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Welcome to the Continuous Delivery Pipeline tutorial for deploying a Node.js web application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This repo will walk you through the process of setting up a continuous delivery pipeline using AWS services such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline. With this pipeline in place, your application will automatically deploy whenever there are updates to your source code.

## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll create a continuous delivery pipeline for a simple web application. We will start by setting up a GitHub repository to store our application's source code. Then, we'll configure various AWS services to automate the build and deployment processes.

### Services Used

- [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/): A Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from AWS that simplifies deploying and managing web applications.
- [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/): A fully managed build service that compiles your source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages.
- [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/): A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the building, testing, and deployment of your application.

### Steps

1. **Set up a GitHub repository for the application code**: Create a GitHub repository to store your application's source code. This will serve as the version control system for your project.

2. **Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment**: Set up an Elastic Beanstalk environment where your Node.js web application will be deployed. Configure the environment according to your application's requirements.

3. **Configure AWS CodeBuild**: Set up AWS CodeBuild to build the source code from your GitHub repository. Configure build specifications, build environment, and other build settings as needed.

4. **Use AWS CodePipeline**: Create an AWS CodePipeline to set up the continuous delivery pipeline. Configure the pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages, connecting GitHub as the source provider and AWS Elastic Beanstalk as the deployment target.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) with appropriate permissions.
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your local development machine.

## Application Architecture

The following diagram provides a visual representation of the services used in this tutorial and how they are interconnected:

This architecture illustrates the flow of our Node.js web application from GitHub through AWS CodeBuild and finally to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment. The automated pipeline ensures that changes to our code are seamlessly built and deployed to our Elastic Beanstalk environment.

Now, let's get started with setting up our continuous delivery pipeline for Node.js web application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Follow the steps outlined in this repository to get your pipeline up and running. Happy coding and deploying!
